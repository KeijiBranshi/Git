/*
I will construct this set based on the axioms from ZFC:

1. Axiom of extensionality
2. Axiom of regularity (also called the Axiom of foundation)
3. Axiom schema of specification (also called the axiom schema of separation or of restricted comprehension)
4. Axiom of pairing
5. Axiom of union
6. Axiom schema of replacement
7. Axiom of infinity
8. Axiom of power set
9. Well-ordering theorem

Chances are these rules will come back to bite me (especially when I start to deal with infinite sets all the implications that come with those). For now, I'll only deal with finite cardinalities (which is really the only kind possible as far as I can see).
